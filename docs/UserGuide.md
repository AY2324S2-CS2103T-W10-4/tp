# <span id='feature-gettingStarted'>  Getting Started <span>

## <span id='feature-install'> Installing and Launching TutorsContactsPro <span>

### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, follow the instructions in [Appendix A: Installing Java](#appendix-a-installing-java).

### Step 2: Download

Download the latest `TutorsContactsPro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/releases).

### Step 3: Set up TutorsContactsPro Home Folder

Copy or move the downloaded `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorsContactsPro.

### Step 4: Launch TutorsContactsPro

1. Open a terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, John Doe has his `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file in `/Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro`, so he'll run:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro
    ```

3. If you are using terminal, verify that your working directory contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar` by using the `ls` command. 
Else if you are using command prompt, verify that your working directory contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar` by using the `dir` command.
You should see `TutorsContactsPro.jar` in the list of files printed. Here's what our John Doe got when running this command.

    ```bash
    JohnDoe@johndoe TutorsContactsPro % ls
    TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```
4. Once your terminal's working directory is the folder that contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar`, run the following command to launch TutorsContactsPro:

    ```bash 
    java -jar TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```

   After executing this command, a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one below should appear shortly:

### <span id='feature-mail'> Generating email template : `mail` <span>

> * `GROUP_NAME` must be in the correct format of `TUT/REC/LAB` + `2-digit number`.
> * `GROUP_NAME` must be a valid existing group.
> * It requires a **full match** for the keyword.
> * `GROUP_NAME` is optional and when no `GROUP_NAME` is entered, email addresses of all students on the current list will be included.
> * If `GROUP_NAME` is entered, only email addresses of students belonging to the `[GROUP_NAME]` specified will be included.

Examples:
* `mail` generates a email template containing email addresses of all students on the current list.
* `mail LAB05` generates a email template containing email addresses of all students belonging to `LAB05` as shown in the image below.

### Saving the data

TutorsContactsPro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorsContactsPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/TutorsContactsPro.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

[//]: # (<box type="warning" seamless>)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorsContactsPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TutorsContactsPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
