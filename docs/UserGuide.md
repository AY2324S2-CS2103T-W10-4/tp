# <span id='feature-gettingStarted'>  Getting Started <span>

## <span id='feature-install'> Installing and Launching TaskHub <span>

### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, follow the steps in [Appendix A: Installing Java](#appendix-a-installing-java).

### Step 2: Download 

Download the latest `TutorsContactsPro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

### Step 3: Set up TutorsContactsPro Home Folder

Copy or move the downloaded `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorsContactsPro.

### Step 4: Launch TutorsContactsPro

1. Open a terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, John Doe has his `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file in `/Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro`, so he'll run:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro
    ```

3. Verify that your working directory contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar` by using the `ls` command. You should see `TutorsContactsPro.jar` in the list of files printed. Here's what our John Doe got when running this command.

    ```bash
    JohnDoe@johndoe TutorsContactsPro % ls
    TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```
4. Once your terminal's working directory is the folder that contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar`, run the following command to launch TutorsContactsPro:

    ```bash 
    java -jar TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```

   After executing this command, a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one below should appear shortly:

   Note: The application comes with some sample data for your reference.

[//]: # (<box type="warning" seamless>)

> [**‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:**]

[Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id='feature-faq'> FAQ <span>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutorsContactsPro home folder.

## <span id='feature-issues'> Known issues <span>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

## <span id='feature-appendix-a-installing-java'> Appendix A: Installing Java <span>

Follow these steps to install Java on your computer:

1. **Download Java 11:**
- Download Java 11 from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) based on your operating system.

2. **Follow the instructions on Oracle's website**
    - Go to the appropriate guide page and follow the instructions based on your operating system to complete the installation.
        - [MacOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
        - [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)
        - [Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-737A84E4-2EFF-4D38-8E60-3E29D1B884B8)

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, open a terminal (on MacOS) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and run the following commands to verify that Java is installed:

  ```
   java -version
  ```
If installed correctly, you should see version information for both Java and the Java Compiler. The message should look something like this:
```
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Now, you're ready to proceed with the launching of TutorsContactsPro. Click [here](#feature-install) to get back to the installation tutorial.
