### Project: TutorsContactsPro

TutorsContactsPro - Level 3 is a desktop major book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
1. Implemented the Group field.
2. Implemented the `mailtg` command that allows users to generate an email.
3. Implemented the `mail` window with a hyperlink that launches the mail client, pre-filling the recipient, subject and body field.
